# sequencing-technologies

This module is a bit different. You will have to use https://biology.datahub.berkeley.edu/ instead of regular datahub or Jupyter to access it. The reason is because we are working with sequencing data that requires a lot of tools. Instead of downloading each of these tools personally, UC Berkeley offers biology.datahub as a resource with most of these tools already downloaded!

Reminder that this module is combined with research ethics, find the google doc on bCourses for more information on this part of the module.
